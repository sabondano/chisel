# chisel

Chisel is a simple markdown parser. It supports basic versions of markdown's headers, paragraphs, 
formatting (<em> and <strong> tags), lists (ordered and unordered), blockquotes, and code blocks features.

I built this little project to practice/improve in the following areas: 
* ruby syntax, style, and refactoring
* TDD (Test-Driven Development): breaking down an application into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration
